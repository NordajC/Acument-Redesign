            <h3>Privacy Policy Hong Kong</h3>
            <p class="indent">We at Acument Group take our responsibilities under Singapore's Personal Data Protection Act 2012 (the "PDPA") and Hong Kong's Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (the "PDPO") seriously. We also recognize the importance of the Personal Data (as defined hereafter) you have entrusted to us and believe that it is our responsibility to properly manage, protect, and process your Personal Data.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">This Policy is designed to assist you in understanding how Acument Group subsidiaries as well as its representatives and/or agents (collectively referred to herein as "Acument Group," "us," "we," or "our") collects, uses, discloses, and/or processes the Personal Data you may provide in the course of the use of our website and/or application and such functionalities, services, or features offered in connection thereof (collectively the "Platform") or in connection with your dealings with, through, or on the same.</p>
            
            <br> <p class="bold">PERSONAL DATA</p> <br>
            <p class="indent">As used in this Policy, “personal data” means data, whether true or not, about a person who can be identified: (a) from that data; or (b) from that data and other information to which we have or are likely to have access.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">Other data provided includes personal data provided when you use our services, apply for a job, or provide feedback.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">Other terms used in this Policy shall have the meanings given to them in the PDPA and the PDPO (where the context so permits).</p>
            
            <br><p class="bold">COLLECTION, USE, AND DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA</p> <br>
            <p class="indent">We collect and process the information about you for the purposes as follow:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Answering enquiries</li>
                <li>Expressing interest in employment</li>
                <li>Signing up for events or newsletter</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p class="indent">We shall seek your consent before collecting any of your personal data. We will not process your information outside of this basis unless we have asked for and received your consent to do so.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">Please note that should you not consent and provide us with the relevant personal information to fulfil the “purposes” of collection, use, and disclosure of your personal information by us, it may hinder our ability to continue to interact with you. We may not be able to make a decision on your suitability for recruitment or employment or comply with the law; therefore, we may not be able to make an offer of employment.</p>
            
            <br> <p class="bold">WITHDRAWING YOUR CONSENT</p> <br>
            <p class="indent">You have the right to withdraw your consent for the collection, use, and/or disclosure of your Personal Data in our possession or under our control by submitting your request in writing or via email to our Data Protection Officer (“DPO”) at the contact details provided below. Your consent personal data will remain valid until such time it is being withdrawn by you in writing.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">Upon receipt of your written request to withdraw your consent, we may require reasonable time (depending on the complexity of the request and its impact on our relationship with you) for your request to be processed and for us to notify you of the consequences of us acceding to the same, including any legal consequences which may affect your rights and liabilities to us. Therefore, you may still receive communication during this period.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">If you withdraw your consent to any or all use of your Personal Data, please note that depending on the nature and scope of your request, we may not be in a position to continue providing our goods or services to you, and we shall in such circumstances notify you by email before completing the processing of your request.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">Please note that withdrawing consent does not affect our right to continue to collect, use, and disclose Personal Data where such collection, use, and disclose without consent is permitted or required under applicable laws.</p>
            
            <br> <p class="bold">ACCESS TO AND CORRECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</p> <br>
            <p class="indent">You have the right to (a) request for access to a copy of the Personal Data which we hold about you or (b) make a correction request to correct or update any of your Personal Data which we hold.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">Please note that a reasonable fee may be charged for an access request. If so, we will inform you of the fee before processing your request. We will only process your request once you have agreed to the payment of the fee.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">We will endeavour to respond to your access and/or correction request within 30 days after receiving such request. If we are unable to respond to your access and/or correction within 30 days after receiving such request, we will inform you in writing within 30 days of the time by which we will be able to respond to the request.</p>
            
            <br> <p class="bold">PROTECTION OF PERSONAL DATA</p> <br>
            <p class="indent">We implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to protect your personal data against unauthorized or unlawful processing, accidental loss, destruction, or damage.</p>
            
            <p class="indent">You should be aware, however, that no method of transmission over the Internet or method of electronic storage is completely secure. While security cannot be guaranteed, we strive to protect the security of your information and are constantly reviewing and enhancing our information security measures.</p>
            
            <br> <p class="bold">ACCURACY OF PERSONAL DATA</p> <br>
            <p class="indent">We will take reasonable steps to ensure that the Personal Data we collect about you is accurate, complete, not misleading, and kept up to date, taking into account its intended use. Where possible, we will validate the Personal Data provided by you using generally accepted practices and guidelines. If we are in an ongoing relationship with you, it is important that you update us of any changes to your business contact information.</p>
             
            <br><p class="bold">RETENTION OF PERSONAL DATA</p> <br>
            <p class="indent">We retain your personal data only for as long as necessary to fulfil the purposes for which we collected it, including for the purposes of satisfying any legal, accounting, or reporting requirements.</p>
            
            <br> <p class="bold">TRANSFERS OF PERSONAL DATA OUTSIDE OF SINGAPORE AND HONG KONG</p> <br>
            <p class="indent">We generally do not transfer your personal data to countries outside of Singapore and Hong Kong. However, if we do so, we will obtain your consent for the transfer to be made, and we will take steps to ensure that your personal data continues to receive a standard of protection that is at least comparable to that provided under the PDPA and PDPO.</p>
            
            <br> <p class="bold">DATA PROTECTION OFFICER</p> <br>
            <p class="indent">You may contact our Data Protection Officer if you have any questions or feedback relating to our personal data protection policies and procedures, withdrawal of your consent, obtain access, or make correction to your personal data. Please contact us at:</p>
